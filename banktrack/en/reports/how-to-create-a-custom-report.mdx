To create a custom periodic report, the first thing you need to do is go to the [Reports](https://app.banktrack.com/informes) section.

Click on the **Add report** button to create a new report. A screen will open with the report settings. On the left side of the screen, you can customize the report's features:

- **Report Name:** The name by which you will identify the report.
- **Frequency:** Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.
- **Reception Time:** The time at which you will receive it.
- **Receive the report even when there are no transactions:** By default, the report will only be sent if there are transactions during the period, but you can select this option to always receive it.
- **Products to Include:** Select the products that will be included in the report. You can also add another bank from this section if you haven't done so already.
- **Channels where the report will be sent:** You can choose one or more channels to receive this report. Additionally, you can customize the email subject or the summary message for each of the channels.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Lists">
    These are lists of items with two formatting options:

    - **Compact List:** To display transactions, only income, or only expenses. Additionally, you can choose to group them by Category, Date, Connection, or Bank Product.

    - **Block List:** To display the balances of the products included in the report.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Tables">
    These are Excel-style tables for viewing the details of income and expenses.

    You can select the number of periods (columns) to include and whether to group the income by Category or Tag.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Charts">
    These allow you to present the information visually. You can choose from 3 types of charts:

    - **Bar Chart:** To display income or expenses in columns.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Text">
    To include a custom text block with dynamic variables.

    ![Text block editor](https://content.gitbook.com/content/IhgipbuJxCqyX8vQOfan/blobs/8nDW0jSM6qcGjDAkQZSg/image.png)

    You can customize the font size and whether to highlight the dynamic variables or not.

    This is very useful for separating sections of the report or providing a descriptive summary.
