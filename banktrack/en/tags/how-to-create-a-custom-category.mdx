Add as many categories as you like to your transactions and organize them your way.

If you want to automate the transaction categorization process, you can do so with [Automations](/banktrack/en/automations/how-to-create-an-automation).

If you have any questions about labels, you can contact us through the chat located in the bottom right corner of the screen.
