Banktrack operates on a Freemium model, meaning we offer a free version with limited features and generate revenue through paid plans that offer more advanced features.

This model allows us to differentiate ourselves from other free applications, whose business model involves selling user data to other companies to offer them recommended products such as loans, insurance, etc.

**At Banktrack, we DO NOT sell your data to third parties. Your data is solely yours.**

Additionally, we comply with privacy legislation (GDPR) under Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament.
