Workspaces allow you to organize your finances for different companies or projects in completely independent dashboards, each with its own banks, users, categories, dashboards, etc.

From a single account, you can access your different workspaces and projects without needing to create multiple accounts in Banktrack.

  Remember that if you want to create a consolidated dashboard for your different companies/banks, you'll need to add all your banks and companies into the same workspace to combine them.

It's important to correctly define this data so that the system can achieve a higher accuracy rate. You can do this by clicking the 🏬 icon of your workspace:
