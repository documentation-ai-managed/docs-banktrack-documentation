When you connect a bank in Banktrack, an automatic synchronization will occur every 6 hours by default.

You can also perform a manual synchronization from the [Banks](https://app.banktrack.com/bancos) section by clicking the 🔄 Sync button.

The transaction history obtained during bank synchronization depends solely on each bank. However, it is possible to perform an extended synchronization to recover the maximum possible transaction history. To do this, select the **Historical Sync** button when you click the 🔄 Manual Sync button.

<Callout kind="alert">
  Historical transaction synchronization may require additional security
  validation (such as an OTP message from the bank, confirming a notification,
  logging into the app, etc.) and takes longer than a standard sync.

If the historical synchronization does not retrieve all the transactions you need, you can always perform a manual transaction import. More information on this can be found on [this help page](/banktrack/en/transactions/how-to-import-transactions).

If you have any questions regarding bank synchronization, you can contact us via the chat you'll find in the bottom right corner of the screen.
