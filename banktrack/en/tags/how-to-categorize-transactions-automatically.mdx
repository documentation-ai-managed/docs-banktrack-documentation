To automatically categorize transactions in Banktrack, you can use [automatic rules](/banktrack/en/automations/how-to-create-an-automation) or add "keywords" to categories.

When a transaction contains one of those keywords in its description, the corresponding category will be applied. This functionality will automatically apply the category to both the transaction history and all new transactions.

If you have any questions about keyword-based categories, you can contact us through the chat located in the bottom right corner of the screen.
