To create a new bank connection, you need to go to the [Banks](https://app.banktrack.com/bancos) section and click on the **Add bank** button to select your bank. Remember, you can choose the country from the dropdown menu on the left side of the search bar.

![Select bank](https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-54c75dd1-b435-4e90-af26-bd7d8846081b/doc-3ced55c8-092e-4386-b871-aab18b35003e/1767001050265-z4748k58ico-image.png?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat)

In some cases, you might see two types of connections: Open Banking (PSD2) and Direct Access.

You can see the differences between these two types of connections in [this help article](/banktrack/en/banks/types-of-bank-connections).

Once you've chosen the connection you prefer, simply continue the linking process following the instructions provided (either in Banktrack or on the bank's website).

Once the connection is complete, if you already have reports and alerts created, you can link the products from the added bank to your existing reports and alerts. If you don't do this now, don't worry; you can do it later from the [reports](/banktrack/en/reports/how-to-create-a-custom-report) and [alerts](/banktrack/en/alerts/how-to-create-a-custom-alert) settings.

If you have any questions about connecting your bank, you can contact us via the chat you'll find in the bottom right corner of the screen.
