    <Callout kind="alert">
      If you do not receive the verification code on your mobile, it's possible that **you haven't accepted WhatsApp's Terms and Privacy Policies**. We recommend **adding the Banktrack bot** (+34 629 95 59 67) **and sending it a message**. It will respond with a link that you need to open on your device to **accept the update.** If you do not accept it, conversations with businesses cannot be initiated.
