At Banktrack, we take security very seriously, which is why we implement all necessary measures to ensure your personal and banking data is secure.

Here are some of the features:

- We use authorized and audited providers approved by the Bank of Spain.
- We only have **read** access to your banking data and can never perform any transactions on your bank accounts.
- We do not store your bank password; the connection process is done via a unique access token.
- All your transaction data is encrypted in our systems.

If you have any questions about security at Banktrack, you can contact us through the chat located in the bottom right corner of the screen.
