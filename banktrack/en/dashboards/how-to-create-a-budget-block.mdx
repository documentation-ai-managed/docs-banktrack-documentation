# How to create a Budget block

To create budget blocks within your dashboards, first, go to the [Dashboards section](https://app.banktrack.com/dashboards).

Create a dashboard or use one of the templates by following the [previously mentioned steps](/banktrack/en/dashboards/how-to-create-a-custom-dashboard).

Once your dashboard is created, simply scroll down to the bottom and click the "**+ Add Block**" button.

A dropdown will then appear on the right side of your screen, where you can add as many blocks as you want to your dashboard. However, to find the budget block, you need to access the "Lists" option.

In this space, you can drag the block to the area of your dashboard that you prefer.

You'll notice that your budget block appears empty at first, but that's because you need to manually add the categories you want to display.

After clicking on the settings to edit the block and add your categories, you should select "**Add Category**," where you can choose the ones you need and add the maximum amount you want to appear to the right of each category.

Finally, your dashboard will appear as follows:
