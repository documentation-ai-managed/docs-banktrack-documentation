From the [transaction search](https://app.banktrack.com/buscar), you can ignore transactions to prevent them from being counted as income or expenses. This is very useful to avoid double entries for income and expenses in transfers between your own accounts, for example.

![Mark as Ignored](https://blob-cdn.documentation.ai/org-54c75dd1-b435-4e90-af26-bd7d8846081b/doc-3ced55c8-092e-4386-b871-aab18b35003e/1767001181605-0gllb63it246-Ignorar_gif.gif?q=85&fm=auto&auto=compress%2Cformat)

If you want to perform this action automatically, you can do so by **creating an automation that carries out this task regularly**. You can find more information about this [on this page](/banktrack/en/automations/how-to-create-an-automation).

If you have any questions regarding unaccounted transactions, you can contact us through the chat located in the bottom right corner of the screen.
