  <Tab title="Direct Access">
    The connection is made by entering your credentials directly into Banktrack, which are securely transmitted and stored by our provider (see more details in [Security](/banktrack/en/information-of-interest/security)).

    **Advantages:**
    - Allows access to all types of products: Current accounts, Credit cards, Investments, Loans, etc.
    - The information obtained is what the user "sees" in their banking app.
    - The connection can last more than 90 days.
    - The balance associated with each bank transaction is retrieved.

    **Disadvantages:**
    - The connection is often less stable due to changes made by banks in their apps.

      If your bank connection frequently expires, we recommend using an *Open Banking* connection via PSD2 API.

    The connection is made by entering your bank login credentials directly on the bank's website.

    **Advantages:**
    - The connection is more stable since it uses the official web service provided by the bank.

    **Disadvantages:**
    - The connection expires every 90 days, requiring you to reconnect the bank after this period.
    - It only allows access to current accounts, without the possibility of viewing other financial products like cards or loans.
    - The balance associated with each bank transaction is not obtained.
    - The transaction information may differ from what is shown on the bank's website, as it is the data sent by the bank through its third-party service.
